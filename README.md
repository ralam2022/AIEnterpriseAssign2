 Python ML on breast cancer data

This exercise involved created a repository locally and then publishing to GitHub.com

As part of this exercise GitHub desktop was used for now while issues on my mac terminal are being resolved and screenshots will be updated accordingly. 

Two branches are in the repository. The UpdatedCode was created as an additional branch. Two Jupyter notebooks were uploaded onto the repository. The 1st notebook was based on the Winsonsin Breast Cancer Dataset along with a Random Forest Algorithm. The 2nd notebook was updated with other algorithms. The notebook also includes the EDA and feature engineering code as well. 

The repositories, code and branches were created locally and committed to GitHub.com via Github desktop. The status was taken from GitHub.com

the repo was also made public and the link included in the submission
